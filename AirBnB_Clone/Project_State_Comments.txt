Project Current State and Comments.

1. The DataMockService Class: has static properties for (Host, Guest, etc) and those are loaded via static methods.
2. The Component classes (e.g. Home, HostMode, etc)  directly uses the DataMockService and we'll improve on this later - as currently it highly coupled.
 We are using directly e.g. MockDataService.Hosts.Single() etc. This is possible because the all properties are static.
 
3. There is a lot of improvements around the design.
